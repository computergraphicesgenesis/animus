Animus Dual-Quaternion Animation Engine

February 25, 2012

Animus is an animation engine, written in WebGL, that uses dual quaternions (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_quaternion) for the translations and rotations of the joints. Currently, it supports posing a character with vertices skinned to single joint, but will eventually support skinning to multiple joints and animated motion.
