Animus
Author: Robert Dionne

Animus is an animation engine, written in WebGL, that uses dual quaternions for the translations and rotations of the joints. Currently, it supports posing a character with vertices skinned to single joint, but will eventually support skinning to multiple joints and animated motion.

Mac OS X support:
Google Chrome 10: http://www.google.com/chrome
Mozilla Firefox 4: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/

Windows 7 support:
Mozilla Firefox 4: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/

To execute:
1) Download animus as a zip file:
https://github.com/robertsdionne/animus/zipball/master

2) Unzip animus.

3) Open file:///path/to/animus.html in your browser.

Currently, animus does not work in Google Chrome 10 on Windows 7. I'll need to debug this issue further.
